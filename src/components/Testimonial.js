                                <p> Aside from teaching dance, I like Mam's emphasis on disciple and life skills. I like how she encourages all children to learn. Every year, we look forward to Navarasa Navaratri and Niranthara Narmada in Kalasindhu. The annual day, which began this year, adds to the appeal of seeing all of the children perform on one stage.
